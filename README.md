This project tracks the movement along the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of the bus stops between Wheaton Station, and my old home in Rockville. The original MIT assignment, did much the same, however with the bus stops between MIT and Harvards' campuses. Each swap takes 1 second, with a small delay at the start.
